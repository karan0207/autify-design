_**Assistant**_

I've read the current code in src/app/page.tsx. Here’s a summary of what it does:

- It’s a Next.js client component for the home page.
- Imports several UI components: Navbar, HeroParallax, ContainerScroll, InfiniteMovingCards, LampComponent, SubscriptionCard, and Button.
- Uses useState and useEffect to detect if the user is on a mobile device (window width ≤ 768px).
- The main layout includes:
  - A Navbar at the top.
  - A hero section with a background gradient, a “Get Started” button, and a large heading.
  - A responsive image (main.jpeg) that changes size based on device type.
  - (Commented out) InfiniteMovingCards for mobile/desktop.
  - A HeroParallax section using products from constants.
  - A section with a LampComponent and SubscriptionCard.
- There are some unused imports (InfiniteMovingCards and clients), as noted by linter errors.
